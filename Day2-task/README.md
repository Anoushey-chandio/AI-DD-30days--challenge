### AIDD 30-Day Challenge # Task 2

### PART (A)

### Q1 Why is using AI development agents like Gemini CLI for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

AI development agents like Gemini CLI automate repetitive setup tasks, which saves time and reduces human errors. This allows you to focus on high-level architecture decisions and system design, understand best practices, and efficiently plan and manage complex systems.

### Q2 Explain How the Nine Pillars help developers grow into M-Shaped Developers?

These nine pillars automate repetitive tasks, ensure quality, integrate AI effectively, and provide broad technical and domain expertise. Together, they enable developers to confidently build end-to-end solutions, creating the multiple 'peaks' of an M-shaped developer deep skills in different areas along with broad AI-augmented capabilities.


### Q3 How does architecture-first thinking change the developer role in AI-DD?
In architecture-first thinking, the developer’s role shifts from writing raw code to designing and orchestrating layers and systems. Each layer (model, IDE, agent) has a distinct responsibility, and the developer chooses tools and workflows strategically to ensure AI works efficiently and changes can be accommodated easily.

### Q4 Why must developers think in layers and systems instead of raw code?
Thinking in layers and systems allows developers to abstract complexity and separate concerns. In AI-DD, each layer has a distinct responsibility—Frontier Models handle reasoning, IDEs handle interaction, and Development Agents handle execution. By focusing on layers, developers can swap tools, scale workflows, and integrate AI effectively without rewriting code, ensuring maintainability, flexibility, and long-term productivity.

### Q5  why does vibe coding usually create problem after one week ?
Vibe Coding is an intuition-driven development approach where a developer writes code immediately without a formal specification, tests it as they go, and adjusts based on feedback. Requirements and structure evolve naturally with the code. It works well for learning, prototyping, and solo projects, but in production or team projects it can cause ambiguity, missing tests, and fragile architecture.
Example:
A developer starts coding without a specification and quickly builds a PDF summarizer. It works initially and is shipped in a few hours.
Week 2: A teammate requests Word support. The code wasn’t designed for multiple formats, and edge cases like large or corrupted files weren’t tested. No spec exists, so the team has different assumptions.
Result: Major refactoring is needed, week 1’s fast progress now costs 3× the time, and team confidence drops.

### Q6 how would specification driven development prevent these problems?

A specification is a clear, written document that defines what a feature will do, how it will behave, which edge cases it will handle, and the exact success criteria. Its purpose is to ensure that developers, the team, and AI all work from the same understanding without guesswork. In the AI era, specs act as the new syntax, guiding both human and AI developers.

 ### SDD 7-Step 
1.	Specify:Write clear requirements, expected behavior, and edge cases for the feature.
2.	Plan:Break the specification into small, achievable parts.
3.	Tasks:Convert each part into testable tasks with acceptance criteria.
4.	Red (Test First):Write tests first to verify the spec (these will initially fail).
5.	Green (Code):Write code to make the tests pass.
6.	Refactor:Clean, optimize, and make the code maintainable.
7.	Explain & Record:Document decisions and share with the team via ADR/PR.
8.	
## SDD Benefits
•	Clear requirements:Reduces misunderstandings and rework.
•	Predictable delivery:Improves estimation and planning.
•	Fewer bugs:Tests catch edge cases upfront.
•	Maintainable codebase:Simplifies future changes.
•	Team alignment:Everyone works with the same mental model.
•	Safe refactoring:Tests ensure nothing breaks.
•	AI-friendly development: Clear specs enable AI to generate high-quality code.
